# Description:
A computer responsive Tennis Game, with virtual simulation by the comuputer against manual play by a player. Made with basic HTML and JavaScript. The game can be played by downloading the index.html file and opening it using any browser.
I have done this from a free Udemy course that walked me through the steps.
